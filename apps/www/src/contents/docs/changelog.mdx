### CLI updates

- Icon library

  We're removed the icon library and using SVG for more flexibility in icons.

- Remove `style` property

  In this update, the `style` property has been removed, but there's a possibility of its return if additional styling features are introduced in future updates.

- Support **custom ui dir**

  You can use this config to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

  ```json title="components.json"
  {
    "aliases": {
      "ui": "@/ui"
    }
  }
  ```

- Support custom **Tailwind prefix**

  You can now configure a custom Tailwind prefix and the cli will automatically prefix your utility classes when adding components.

  A drop-in for your existing design system with no conflict. ðŸ”¥

  ```tsx /tw-/
  <AlertDialog class="tw-grid tw-gap-4 tw-border tw-bg-background tw-shadow-lg" />
  ```

  It works with `cn`, `cva` and CSS variables.

That's it. Happy Lunar New Year.
